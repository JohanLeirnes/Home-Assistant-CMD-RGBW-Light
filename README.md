I am a complete novice in python and coding in general so this is just an idea I
had, to create a general purpose rgbw light module for home assistant that could
be controlled by the command line.

If someone with the knowhow of Home Assistant and/or python would like to
continue on this and make it work that would be very awesome.

(code ripped from the Command line switch and LimitlessLED)
